Migrate to Server API v4

**BREAKING CHANGES**: This release contains multiple breaking changes:

- SDK version bumped to `8.0.0`
- Server API version upgraded from v3 to v4
- Removed `GetVisits` and `GetRelatedVisitors` operations.
- Improved models used by the `GetEvent` and `SearchEvents` operations to use a more concise shape and clearer names.
